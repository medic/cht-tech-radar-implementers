  "footerFootnote": "The Community Health Toolkit (CHT) is a project by a group of leading organizations who have come together to support the development of digital health initiatives in the hardest-to-reach areas. It provides a collection of open source technologies and open access design, technical, and implementer resources that help you build and deploy digital tools for community health. Together, we envision a world where healthcare is of the highest attainable quality, equitable, accessible, and delivered by people who are trusted in their communities.  ",

Items that have been on the radar in previous versions are not listed on the homepage, but they are still available in the complete overview and in the search."

This results in more informed and coordinated decisions.",
