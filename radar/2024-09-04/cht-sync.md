[CHT Sync](https://github.com/medic/cht-sync) is a integrated solution designed to enable data synchronization between CouchDB and PostgreSQL for the purpose of analytics. The synchronization occurs near real-time, ensuring that the data displayed on dashboards is up-to-date. It combines several technologies to achieve this synchronization and provides an efficient workflow for data processing and visualization.
