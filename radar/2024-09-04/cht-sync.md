[CHT Sync](https://github.com/medic/cht-sync) is a bundled solution consisting of Logstash, CouchDB, PostgREST, DBT, and Superset. Its purpose is to synchronize data from CouchDB to PostgreSQL, facilitating analytics on a Superset dashboard. 
This synchronization occurs in real-time, ensuring that the data displayed on the dashboard is always up-to-date.
