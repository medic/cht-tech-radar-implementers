[Data Observation Toolkit (DOT)](https://github.com/datakind/Data-Observation-Toolkit) can be used to monitor data in order to flag problems with data integrity and scenarios that might need attention. 
Typical tests include checks for missing/duplicate and inconsistent data, outliers, and domain-specific signals such as a missed follow-up medical treatment after initial diagnosis.

DOT includes a simple user interface for configuring the powerful DBT and Great Expectations libraries, as well as a database for storing and classifying data monitoring results.
