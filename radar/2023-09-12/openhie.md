OpenHIE is a community of practice that also provides an architecture and specification for interoperability for the digital health ecosystem. Medic is an active partner in the OpenHIE community, and strives to use OpenHIE standards in designing and building integrations.

From OpenHIE:
A Health Information Exchange (HIE) makes sharing health data across information systems possible. It enables data to be shared between databases, facilities, and across regions or countries.

OpenHIE’s Architecture is made up of patterns that ensure that health information from various external systems is gathered into a single, uniﬁed HIE. To accomplish this, the exchange normalizes the context in which health information is used by focusing on the “for whom”, ”by whom”, “where”, and “what” of a patient’s health visit, bringing relevant information through a layer of interoperability and directly to the point of service. Additionally, OpenHIE also integrates medical supply data. This supports enhanced decision-making, improves the quality, safety, and continuity of care, and facilitates the appropriate use of information to improve health in a population.
