Medic OS is a space-efficient Linux-based operating system, designed specifically to run Medic's mHealth platform. This is the build system and source code; Docker images will be available on Medic's website.

From CHT Core Framework 4.0.0 onwards the Docker image is based on Alpine, a third party lightweight linux OS, so Medic OS is now deprecated.
