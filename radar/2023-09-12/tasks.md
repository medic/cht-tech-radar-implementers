Tasks ensure that the right actions are taken for the right people at the right time. Tasks help CHWs plan their day by prompting them to complete follow-up visits and other activities. 
The list might include upcoming scheduled ANC or Immunization visits, treatment or referral follow-ups, or other required activities such as a household survey.
