The [CHT Core Framework](https://github.com/medic/cht-core) makes it faster to build responsive, offline-first digital health apps that equip health workers to provide better care in their communities. 
It is a central resource of the Community Health Toolkit.

Read more about the CHT Core Framework's architecture in the [CHT documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/core/overview/architecture/).
