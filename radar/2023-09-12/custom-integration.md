[Custom Integration](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/building/integrations/) is the capability to integrate with any system using RESTful APIs. 

The CHT Core Framework includes functionality that allows sharing data with any API-based system. Developers have configured CHT integrations with OpenMRS, KenyaEMR, Bahmni, DHIS2, RapidPro, Apache NiFi, OpenHIM, custom electronic medical records (EMR), and several other systems.
