CHT Watchdog is a monitoring and alerting stack for the CHT built on Prometheus and Grafana. 
Prometheus records real-time metrics from a CHT instance and stores them in a time series database. 
Grafana allows to visualize the metrics in configurable dashboards and sends alerts when metrics exceed a threshold.
