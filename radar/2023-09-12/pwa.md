A PWA is a web application that can be used like a website in the browser, but the user can choose to “install” it. This means a shortcut is added to the home screen of the device, and when the application is run it doesn’t have the usual browser address bar and tabs so it looks like a regular application.

The CHT Core webapp has been developed to be a PWA to give users more choice about how applications are installed.

Read more about the CHT Core webapp as a PWA in the [CHT documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/core/overview/pwa/).
