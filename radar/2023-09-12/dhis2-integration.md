Send aggregate, patient, and event data to DHIS2. In communities using digital health apps built with the CHT, health systems can reduce or eliminate the need to complete paper based forms for DHIS2 reporting needs. This gives health workers more time to focus on caring for the families in their community while also increasing accuracy and timeliness of their DHIS2 reporting requirements.
