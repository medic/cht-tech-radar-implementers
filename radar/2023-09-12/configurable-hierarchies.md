Organizing people and places, and their relationship to one-another. The Core Framework requires a hierarchy to organize the information in the app. It is often based on the hierarchy of a health system within a particular geographic region. Large deployment sites often need three or more levels of place hierarchy, while some small sites need fewer than three levels. For this reason, the Core Frameworkâ€™s information hierarchies are configurable to meet a users needs.
