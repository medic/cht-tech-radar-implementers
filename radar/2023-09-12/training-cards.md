Training Cards enable remote training from within the CHT by showing a sequence of “cards” containing content provided by App Developers. The content might include information about a newly deployed feature, changes to a care guide, or simply a reminder about an underused feature or workflow. Enketo forms are used to display the content, and App Developers can specify a start date, duration, and to which user roles the cards should be shown. Like app forms, forms used by training cards will automatically be downloaded to the user’s devices.
