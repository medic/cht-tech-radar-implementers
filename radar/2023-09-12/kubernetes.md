[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), also known as k8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Kubernetes platform is used for hosting the CHT. For self-hosting partners we recommend lightweight implementations like k3d. For cloud deployments, use a Platform as a Service offering like Amazon EKS.
