Purging is a tool that allows you to increase performance and available disk space for offline users (eg CHWs) by removing unneeded documents from their device. As users continually generate new reports their performance may naturally degrade as a result. You can use purging to remove older documents that are no longer relevant from their devices. Purging only removes documents from userâ€™s devices: these reports are still available for online analytics and impact metrics.
