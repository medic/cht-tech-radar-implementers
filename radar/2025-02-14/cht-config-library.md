[cht-config-library](https://github.com/jkuester/cht-config-library) contains examples of CHT configurations to illustrate certain features of the CHT. The goal of this library is to demonstrate functionality with simplicity and clarity and not to provide comprehensive production-ready configurations that map to real-world use cases.
